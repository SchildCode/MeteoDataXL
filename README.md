# MetetDataXL
MetetDataXL is a macro-enabled Microsoft Excel workbook.
It enables simple and fast downloading of hourly weather data direct to Excel from met.no (Frost API, Norway only) and NIBIO (AgroMetBase, Norway and Sweden) and the Netatmo API (global). Advanced quality-checking and gap-filling.

### Features:
- Dynamic menu, search for available parameters for a given station and/or dates, or search for available stations for a given parameter
- Lists the nearest stations for a given latitude & longitude, municipality, or for a given meteo station
- Practically unlimited number of observations can be downloaded from the Frost-API/AgroMetBase web services, i.e. many years and parameters
- You can paste in data from your own sources, to use the quality-checking and gap-filling features
- Downloads quality flags from Met.no, which indicate the quality of data for each hour
- Vets data for jumps, extreme values, and static values (dead sensor); calculates sigma value for these errors (threshold sigma can be changed)
- Finds outliers (calculates sigma value) by comparing observations with multiple nearby stations
- Hotkey CTRL+N jumps to the next period containing outlier values
- Parameter-specific code for checking quality, e.g. checks relative humidity, dew-point and dry-bulb temperatures for equivalence
- Special code for solar radiation (global, direct, or diffuse) including checking for incorrect time-stamp, correction for night-time calibration offset, automatic detection of obscuring features such as trees or masts that shade the pyranometer, and comparison with clear-sky irradiance (REST2-model)
- Visualizes the data (scatter-plot comparing with nearby stations) and carpet plot
- Parameter-specific gap-filling, which prioritizes moving observations from best-fit nearby stations (kriging by regression), and if such data is unavailable then the gaps are filled by interpolation using a method similar to Kalman filter, which faithfully reproduces the diurnal profile.
